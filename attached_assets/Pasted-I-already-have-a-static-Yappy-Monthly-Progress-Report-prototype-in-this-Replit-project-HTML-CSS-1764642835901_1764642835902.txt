I already have a static “Yappy Monthly Progress Report” prototype in this Replit project (HTML + CSS only, no backend).
It currently has:
	•	Page 1: Global Overview (hero metrics, Key Insights, Program Overview)
	•	Page 2: Tactical section (Tactical Rollup + Southern Rail deep-dive card on the same page)
	•	Page 3: Always On Program Highlights (AO metrics, Top AO Targets, Top Performing Content, Program Narrative).

Please modify the existing code (don’t rebuild from scratch) with the changes below.

⸻

1) Split the Tactical view into two pages for A/B testing
	•	Keep the Global Overview page as Page 1.
	•	Turn the current Tactical content into two separate pages:
	•	Page 2 → “Tactical Rollup” view (table only + short intro if needed).
	•	Page 3 → “Tactical: Southern Rail Logistics” deep-dive (card layout only).
	•	Adjust any navigation or page headings so it’s clear which page is which.

2) Tactical Rollup table — extend and add Influence Level

On Page 2 (Tactical Rollup):
	•	Extend the existing rollup table so it includes 6 tactical targets, not just 3.
	•	For each row, keep the current columns:
	•	Target
	•	Audience Size
	•	Roles Reached (with MoM trend)
	•	Completed Views (with MoM trend)
	•	Watch Time (with MoM trend)
	•	New Roles (with MoM trend)
	•	Add a visual “Influence Level” indicator next to each Target name:
	•	Levels: High, Medium, Low.
	•	This is derived from the “Interest Score” (VTR: completed views ÷ impressions), but you can hard-code placeholder levels for now.
	•	Style it as a pill/badge immediately to the right of the target name.
	•	Use a grey → green scale, no oranges/yellows/reds:
	•	Low: light grey background, dark grey text
	•	Medium: soft desaturated green background, darker green text
	•	High: stronger green background, white text
	•	The table should still be clean and compact enough to print as a PDF.

Also update the page title at the top of Page 2 to:

Tactical Rollup

3) Tactical Deep Dive page — Southern Rail Logistics

On Page 3, create a dedicated deep-dive page for Southern Rail Logistics using the existing deep-dive card as the starting point, but:
	•	Update the page title at the top to:
Tactical: Southern Rail Logistics
	•	Replace the old “High Priority” label on the card with an Influence Level badge (same visual language as the rollup table: High / Medium / Low, with grey→green color scales).
	•	In the Role Group Influence table:
	•	Expand it to show 5 role groups (top 5 priority groups for this tactical), e.g.:
	•	Operations
	•	Finance
	•	Risk & Compliance
	•	Technology
	•	C-Suite
	•	For each role group, keep the columns: Impressions, Views, Complete Views, New Roles (this month).
	•	In the Tactical Insights block at the bottom:
	•	Explicitly call out Key Roles that were new this month (by title).
	•	e.g. “New this month: Director of Operations, Head of Compliance”.
	•	Explicitly call out Key Roles that showed repeat engagement this month.
	•	e.g. “Repeat engagement: CFO, Plant Manager, Head of Maintenance”.
	•	Use two concise bullet points or sub-sections:
	•	“New Key Roles Reached”
	•	“Key Roles with Repeat Engagement”

Keep the rest of the deep-dive structure (metrics block, priority messages, best performing message) as is, just adjust spacing to fit the expanded role table and updated insights.

4) Move Program Narrative to Page 1 and merge with Key Insights
	•	On Page 3 (Always On), remove the existing dark “Program Narrative” block at the bottom.
	•	On Page 1 (Global Overview):
	•	Take that same narrative block style (dark background, striking visual) and move it to Page 1, placing it below Key Insights or replacing/merging with Key Insights.
	•	The end result on Page 1 should be:
	•	Global hero metrics
	•	Program Overview grid
	•	A single Program Narrative / Key Insights section using the dark narrative block style (icon + bullets).
	•	Feel free to merge the existing Key Insights bullets into that dark block so it feels like one strong “story” section rather than two separate ones.

Ensure typography and spacing still feel balanced on Page 1.

⸻

5) Always On page updates — Top 5 Targets & Content, Awareness Level

On the Always On Program Highlights page (now without the Program Narrative at the bottom):
	•	Keep the existing Program Performance hero metrics at the top.
	•	Update Top Always On Targets:
	•	Expand this table to show Top 5 AO targets (instead of 3).
	•	Rename the column “Awareness Stage” → “Awareness Level”.
	•	Keep the pill styling but update the label text to match the new name.
	•	Order the rows by biggest % movement in Completed Views during the reporting period (you can hard-code example values and sort them visually).
	•	Update Top Performing Content:
	•	Expand to show Top 5 content pieces (instead of 2).
	•	Order them by biggest % movement in Completed Views (again, static placeholder values are fine; just sort accordingly).
	•	Keep the existing card layout (title, subtitle, metrics on the right), simply duplicate and adjust content.

With Program Narrative now on Page 1, use the freed space on the AO page to make the Top 5 Targets and Top 5 Content sections more prominent and well spaced.

6) General notes
	•	Keep the existing visual language: Yappy orange (#F77C22), greys (#EAEBEC, #A9A9A9, #272525), green (#9FC64B) for positive indicators, and subtle reds only where already used for negative trends.
	•	Use existing typography (Poppins for headings, Inter/body) and spacing scale.
	•	Maintain PDF-friendly layout: no overflowing content, keep tables and blocks within printable width.

Please update the current HTML/CSS to apply these changes while preserving the overall aesthetic and structure of the prototype.
