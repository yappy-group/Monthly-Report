1) Update the hero metrics (Page 1)

On Page 1, update the hero metric row so it shows exactly these 4 metrics, program-wide (AO + Tacticals):
	1.	Roles Reached (Total) – total individual roles reached across all campaigns this month
	2.	Key Roles Engaged (Tacticals) – number of key roles engaged in Tactical campaigns this month
	3.	Watch Time (Hours) – total content watch time across all campaigns this month
	4.	Active Targets (Total) – total number of target accounts with active campaigns this month

For each metric card:
	•	Keep the existing style (label, large value, small MoM trend pill with arrow and %).
	•	Update the labels and placeholder values to align with the above definitions.
	•	Ensure the order is: Roles Reached → Key Roles Engaged → Watch Time → Active Targets.

Add a small caption line under the hero row:

“All metrics shown are for this month across all Always On and Tactical campaigns.”

2) Add a Program Overview grid (Page 1, below hero metrics)

Under the hero metrics and insights block on Page 1, add a Program Overview section to give context (not performance trends).

Use a simple 2×2 grid of small cards / panels:
	•	Always On Coverage
	•	“AO Target Accounts: XX total”
	•	“New AO Targets this month: +Y”
	•	Tactical Activity
	•	“Active Tactical Campaigns: X”
	•	“New/Paused this month: …”
	•	Content Library
	•	“Active Content Pieces: X”
	•	“Total Library: Y”
	•	Program Objectives
	•	Short bullet list with: “Decision Chain Influence”, “Brand Awareness”, “Value Proposition Clarity”

Visually:
	•	Use the existing card / panel style: light border, subtle radius, no heavy shadows.
	•	Keep copy short, like a fact sheet.
	•	Make sure spacing matches the rest of the page (8/16/24px scale).

3) Create a new Tactical table on the Tactical page (Page 2)

On the Tactical page, at the top, add a Tactical Rollup Table that compares all active tacticals.

Use this column structure:

| Target | Audience Size | Roles Reached | Completed Views | Watch Time | New Roles |

For each row:
	•	Target – tactical/target name (e.g. “Southern Rail Logistics”)
	•	Audience Size – total addressable audience (e.g. 38,000)
	•	Roles Reached – show value + MoM trend (e.g. 140  ▲ +12%)
	•	Completed Views – value + MoM trend (e.g. 312  ▼ –8%)
	•	Watch Time – value + MoM trend (e.g. 24h  ▲ +3%)
	•	New Roles – value + MoM trend (e.g. +7  ▲ +2)

Design details:
	•	Use a clean, simple table style (no row borders except header line and maybe alternating row shading).
	•	Trend indicators should be small arrows + % or delta, using the existing green/red color tokens from the design system.
	•	Keep text compact so the table fits nicely across the page and prints cleanly as a PDF.

Place this table at the top of the Tactical page, above any existing tactical cards/content.

4) Add a Tactical Deep Dive for one tactical (Page 2)

Under the new Tactical Rollup Table, add a “Top Tactical Deep Dive” card for one tactical (e.g. the first row in the table).

Layout the deep dive as a single card/block with this structure:
	•	Header line:
	•	“Tactical: [Target Name] (e.g. Southern Rail Logistics)”
	•	Include campaign duration (e.g. “Running for 8 months”) and sector (e.g. “Heavy Industry”) in smaller text.
	•	Metrics block (two-column grid):
	•	Left side:
	•	Audience Size
	•	Roles Reached
	•	Key Roles Engaged
	•	New Roles
	•	Right side:
	•	Impressions
	•	Completed Views
	•	Watch Time (hours)
	•	Priority Messages Delivered:
	•	A short list (3 bullet points) of message titles, styled as bullets or small tags.
	•	Best Performing Message:
	•	Message name as a sub-heading.
	•	Below it: “Impressions: X”, “Views: Y”, “Complete Views: Z”.
	•	Role Group Influence Summary:
	•	A small table or list by role group (e.g. C-Suite, Operations, Finance, Risk, Technology) with basic numbers:
	•	Impressions | Views | Complete Views | New Roles this month
	•	Insights block:
	•	1–2 short bullets that interpret the data (placeholder copy is fine), e.g.:
	•	“Growing interest from Operations and Finance roles, with increasing repeat engagement.”
	•	“C-Suite engagement remains lower but is starting to show early signs of traction.”

Visual style:
	•	Use the same card styling as other panels (white, soft border, small radius).
	•	Use headings (H3 style) for sub-sections: “Metrics (this month)”, “Priority Messages”, “Best Performing Message”, “Role Group Influence”, “Insights”.
	•	Ensure this deep dive card fits comfortably on the page below the table when printed.

5) General guidelines
	•	Reuse existing CSS tokens and type styles (Yappy orange, greys, Poppins for headings, Inter for body).
	•	Do not remove the existing Always On page; just update Page 1 and Page 2 as described.
	•	Keep all data mocked/static for now; focus on layout, hierarchy, and styling.

Please update the existing HTML and CSS to implement these changes, preserving the current aesthetic and layout rhythm while adding these new elements.
