Please refine and upgrade the current design while keeping the existing structure and content.
I’m not using any backend or frameworks – just HTML + CSS.

1. Page header improvements (all pages)
	•	Keep the “Monthly Progress Report / November 2025 / Client” header, but:
	•	Slightly increase the title weight and tighten line-height for a stronger presence.
	•	Add a subtle horizontal divider below the header using a light border (#E3E4E6) to anchor the page.
	•	Make the client name a little bolder than the “CLIENT” label so it reads as a proper identifier.

2. Hero KPI card refinements (Global + Tactical + AO)
	•	For all KPI rows (Global Overview, Tactical metrics row, AO metrics row):
	•	Keep the card layout but add either:
	•	a very subtle border (1px solid #E3E4E6) or
	•	a faint background tint using the Yappy light grey (#EAEBEC at ~4–6%).
	•	Ensure the trend indicator (arrow + % or delta) is vertically centered and consistently aligned across all cards.
	•	Use a small pill-style background behind trends (soft green for up, soft red for down), but keep it subtle and in line with the brand.

3. Tactical cards (Southern Rail / Apex / Pacific) polish
	•	Each tactical card already shows:
	•	Name, one-line description, metrics row (Reached, Engaged, Watch Time, Impressions, Comp. Views) and bullets.
	•	Please:
	•	Ensure every card includes a one-line contextual subtitle under the title (where missing) so they’re consistent.
	•	Style the role group tags (e.g. Ops, Finance, Risk) as proper chips:
	•	Light grey background, rounded corners, small padding (6px x 10px), dark grey text.
	•	Increase the spacing between the metrics row and the bullet insights slightly for readability.

(Optional but nice: if simple to do, add a tiny 40–60px wide sparkline placeholder for “watch time trend” inside each tactical card, aligned to the right of the metrics row. It can be a simple SVG or CSS gradient bar – just visual, no real data needed.)

4. Tactical Insights block
	•	Keep the “Tactical Insights” panel at the bottom of the Tactical page but:
	•	Give it a subtle background tint (very light grey) so it feels like a summary block.
	•	Add a small orange icon or bullet marker to the left of the heading to tie it visually to the other section icons.

5. Always On page header and structure
	•	For the Always On page:
	•	Change the main section heading near the top from “Monthly Progress Report” to “Always On Program Highlights — November 2025” (or similar), so it’s clear this page is AO-focused.
	•	Keep the small logo / client region as is.

6. AO Target table enhancements
	•	In the “Top Always On Targets” table:
	•	Style the Awareness Stage labels (High, Medium, Low) as coloured pills:
	•	High: soft red tint background, red text.
	•	Medium: soft orange tint background, orange text.
	•	Low: soft grey tint background, dark grey text.
	•	Maintain subtle, clean styling (no heavy saturation).

7. Top Performing Content cards
	•	For each content row in “Top Performing Content”:
	•	Add a small square thumbnail placeholder (40x40px) on the left of the title.
	•	Keep the title and subtitle stacked to the right of the thumbnail.
	•	Align the right-hand metrics (IMP, VIEWS, ORGS) to a fixed width so they line up consistently between rows.

8. Program Narrative block
	•	The dark Program Narrative block is great. Please:
	•	Add a small orange icon (e.g. a simple outline circle with a check/insight symbol) to the left of the heading “Program Narrative”.
	•	Slightly increase line spacing on the bullet text for better legibility against the dark background.

9. Consistency & tokens
	•	Use the existing Yappy design tokens:
	•	Primary orange #F77C22, greys #EAEBEC, #A9A9A9, #272525, red #D11E1A, yellow-orange #FFAB2D, green #9FC64B.
	•	Heading font: Poppins, body font: Inter (fall back to system fonts).
	•	Ensure heading styles (H1, H2, section labels) and spacing between sections are consistent across all three pages.

Please modify the existing HTML and CSS rather than rewriting everything from scratch. Keep the current content and structure, but apply the visual refinements and class/style adjustments described above so the prototype feels like a polished, production-ready monthly report.
